# CustomDebian - Customizable Pentesting Debian Script

## Overview

CustomDebian is an script that provides a productive, efficient and customizable Debian for anyone interested in penetration testing and cibersecurity. The project started as an idea of creating my own distribution, but before committing to something so ambitious, I had to start learning more about Debian and how it works, so first off, I'm starting with a basic script with some tools I use to practice and learn more about cybersecurity, so I hope you guys can learn as well.
